	    <dl>
		<dt>CNR</dt>
		<dd>Carrier to Noise Ratio. An average of CNR data where Status is 1. (A Status value of 1 indicates with high probability that the lidar recorded the laser signal rather than background noise.) To further reduce noise, I also counted every range/time combination with 3 or fewer Status==1 measurements as missing data.</dd>
		<dt>DRWS</dt>
		<dd>Dispersion Radial Wind Speed. Calculated with the same method as CNR.</dd>
		<dt>Horizontal Wind Speed, Vertical Wind Speed, x Wind Speed, y Wind Speed</dt>
		<dd>Average of wind estimates made by combining the radial wind speed estimates from 5 consecutive scans in DBS mode. All 5 consecutive measurements must have a Status of 1 for a wind estimate to be recorded.</dd>
		<dt>Wind Direction, wind barb overlay</dt>
		<dd>Average horizontal wind speeds (same as the wind speeds above). For legibility I'm only showing the values at 30-minute intervals and I'm averaging heights in 250m bins.</dd>
		<dt>Temperature, Vapor Density, Liquid, Relative Humidity</dt>
		<dd>Averages of the corresponding microwave radiometer datasets from the 'Zenith' processor where quality is 1.</dd>
