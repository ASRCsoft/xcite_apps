	    <p>(All data is aggregated into 5 minute intervals.)</p>
	    <dl>
		<dt>CNR</dt>
		<dd>Carrier to Noise Ratio. An average of CNR data where Status is 1. (A Status value of 1 indicates with high probability that the lidar recorded the laser signal rather than background noise.) To further reduce noise, I also counted every range/time combination with less than 3 Status==1 measurements as missing data.</dd>
		<dt>DRWS</dt>
		<dd>Dispersion Radial Wind Speed. Calculated with the same method as CNR.</dd>
		<dt>Horizontal Wind Speed, Vertical Wind Speed, x Wind Speed, y Wind Speed</dt>
		<dd>Average of wind estimates made by combining the radial wind speed estimates from 5 consecutive scans in DBS mode. All 5 consecutive measurements must have a Status of 1 for a wind estimate to be recorded.</dd>
		<dt>Wind Direction, wind barb overlay</dt>
		<dd>Average horizontal wind speeds (same as the wind speeds above). To cut down the overwhelming number of wind barbs the graphs may only show the values at certain time intervals and heights may be averaged into larger bins. For example, a graph with one day of data will only display wind barbs at 20-minute intervals, ignoring the values at other 5-minute periods.</dd>
		<dt>Temperature, Vapor Density, Liquid, Relative Humidity</dt>
		<dd>Averages of the corresponding microwave radiometer datasets where quality is 1.</dd>
		<dt>PBL (Residual Layer)</dt>
		<dd>Estimated using the gradient method. When there are no clouds, select the steepest downward CNR gradient (derivative with respect to range). When there are clouds, select the bottom of the highest cloud.</dd>
